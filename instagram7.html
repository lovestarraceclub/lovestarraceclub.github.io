The 2017 Barry Roubaix was wet and rainy with average temps hovering around 34 degrees. I finished my ride, and through poor planning on my part, was left outside waiting for a teammate who had the car keys. I was soaked, borderline hypothermic, tired and rather miserable...so in desperation, I ventured inside ACE hArdware to try and warm up and stay out of the rain. I stood in the entryway covered in mud, dripping water, visibly shaking from the cold...as I stood there, other cyclists who were in a similar situation started to gather in the entryway with me.
Now, anytime you have an event like this, where 3500 cyclists converge on a small town and take it over for a day, there are many reasons for local residents and businesses to begrudge &quot;tourists&quot; like myself. I had this in mind as I tracked my muddy footprints into the store. As the group of muddy road-weary cyclists gathered by the heater inside the ACE entryway, I began to expect that a store manager would soon be sent over to ask us to move along, and I wouldn't have blamed them. 
However...
The staff at ACE Hardware not only welcomed me (and all the other cyclists) but they checked in on us regularly to ask if we needed anything. Then the store staff set up a keurig coffee machine and started serving us hot drinks to try and help us warm up. There was no rush to get us out of the store, or any sense of annoyance at our muddy invasion of their business space. Just genuine goodwill. I have a local ACE hardware in my hometown of Evanston IL that will now be my primary hardware store, and my future trips to Barry Roubaix will most certainly include a stop at the Hastings ACE. This store was a shining example of a local business going way above and beyond. 
Thank you to that store team for taking such good care of us...it was appreciated more than you know. #acehardware #bicycle #cycling #lovestarraceclub #gravelgrinder #barryroubaix #groad #gravel" rel="lightbox" class="fancybox">
